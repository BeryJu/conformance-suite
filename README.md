This is the main repository for the Open Banking Brasil conformance suite, 
which covers Functional APIs published at https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/

The project is located at https://gitlab.com/obb1/certification/ 
and all issues / merge requests should be submitted there.

See the wiki for more info: https://gitlab.com/obb1/certification/-/wikis/home 

Note that this Conformance Suite shares its core code with the OpenID Foundation's
FAPI Conformance Suite, which is available at https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite

Many operations are also shared, meaning those instructions will be interchangeable.
